  Find the cross sectional area for a given binary image, 
  point, and normal vector.

  binimg: a binary 2d or 3d numpy image (e.g. a bool datatype)
  pos: the point in the image from which to extract the section
    must be an integer (it's an index into the image).
    e.g. [5,10,2]
  normal: a vector normal to the section plane, does not
    need to be a unit vector. e.g. [sqrt(2)/2. sqrt(2)/2, 0]
  anisotropy: resolution of the x, y, and z axis
    e.g. [4,4,40] for an electron microscope image with 
    4nm XY resolution with a 40nm cutting plane in 
    serial sectioning.
  return_contact: if true, return a tuple of (area, contact)
    where area is the usual output and contact is non-zero if
    the section plane has contacted the edge of the image
    indicating the area may be an underestimate if you are
    working with a cutout of a larger image.

    Contact is an 8-bit bitfield that represents which image faces
    have been touched. The bits are organized as follows.

    0: 0 X     2: 0 Y     4: 0 Z      6: Unused
    1: Max X   3: Max Y   5: Max Z    7: Unused

  slow_method: Calculate plane intersections at every
    voxel. Used for automated testing to ensure
    all locations are visited. Does not restrict analysis
    to a single connected component.

  use_persistent_data: Use a pre-allocated buffer for
    internally tacking visited positions. You allocate the
    buffer with xs3d.set_shape and clear it with xs3d.clear_shape.
    This can save about 20% of the time when repeatedly
    analyzing a shape.
